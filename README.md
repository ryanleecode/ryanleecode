### Hi 👋,

I'm Ryan and I'm currently a software engineer on the AWS S3 Index Team in Vancouver, but working remotely in Toronto! Previously I worked at [Interac](https://www.interac.ca/en/) building the next generation in payments technologies. 

My nerd interests include:
- Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain
- Practical Functional Reactive Programming
- Starcraft and RTS games

I also maintain a blog on [functional programmming with fp-ts](https://rlee.dev/writing/practical-guide-to-fp-ts-part-1).

Currently looking for the new big opportunity in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space!

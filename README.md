## About Me
I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for Blockchain, AI, and functional programming. I love pushing the boundaries of technology and am constantly seeking out the latest trends. When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching Warcraft III and Starcraft I videos. I'm an ambitious individual who values trust, open communication, and efficiency. Fun fact: I was a top 50 grandmaster in Starcraft II during the Heart of the Swarm era.
